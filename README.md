Abstract:  
Voice casting has always been challenging in the multimedia industry. Recent research shows that voice casting can be done with the help of speaker recognition methods. In this paper, the first dataset for dubbing from English to Persian/Farsi is introduced named E2PCast, English to Persian Voice Casting Dataset. The E2PCast dataset includes audio segments from 30 movie characters (15 females and 15 males) in Persian and English. Approximately, the dataset contains a total of 2.5 hours of audio in Persian and English languages (5 hours and 17 minutes in total). In addition to explaining the description of data collection, this paper reports the results of the tests performed on the dataset. The experiments and their evaluations include the automatic voice casting benchmark system and speaker recognition tests to check characters' overall identity distribution in the dataset. Based on the benchmark results, the overall test accuracy of the Siamese neural network method on the dataset is 63.52%. Also, the average accuracy of the 5-fold cross-validation test (without common identity in the train and development data) is equal to 52.58%. 
The E2PCast dataset will be available for free for educational purposes only.
